# shrub-hub

This is the final project of 5 people who graduated from Northcoders bootcamp. It uses Firebase and axios  as its back-end, react-native for its front-end, and also Typescript.

It is a mobile app to guide people who are interested with growing house plants. We have used the perenual.com API to get the plants info. Also utilised from the Google Maps API to show the user their nearest plant nurseries in Leeds area.

Users can log their own plants to the app. They also can log their wished plants to a list. The app has a forum that they can ask questions and get answers about house plants.

The project is made by 5 junior software developers, Zak, Daniel, Elif, Sarah and Matt.
